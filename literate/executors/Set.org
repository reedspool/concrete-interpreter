#+TITLE: Set Executor service
#+PROPERTY: header-args    :comments both :tangle ../../src/executors/set.js

Executors must be XState services and for this one we've chosen the callback type of service.

For this we just defer to the machine to do all the work.

#+begin_src js
export const service = (C) => (sendParent, receiveParent) => {
    const [ block, address ] = C.activeFrame.arguments;
    
    sendParent({ type: "PLACE_BLOCK_AT_ADDRESS", address, block });
    sendParent("DONE");
};
#+end_src
