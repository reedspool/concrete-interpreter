#+TITLE: Algebraic Executor Factory
#+PROPERTY: header-args    :comments both :tangle ../../src/executors/AlgebraicExecutorFactory.js

Lots of algebraic operators have the same form, only the operator changes. This file is a factory to simplify the creation of binary algebraic operator executors.

Executors must be XState services and for this one we've chosen the callback type of service.

        (memo, block) => fnBinaryOp(memo, block.asJS()), first.asJS());
