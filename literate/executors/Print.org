#+TITLE: Print Executor service
#+PROPERTY: header-args    :comments both :tangle ../../src/executors/print.js

Executors must be XState services and for this one we've chosen the callback type of service.

#+begin_src js
export const service = (C) => (sendParent, receiveParent) => {
    console.log(C.activeFrame.arguments.map(block => block.asJS()));
    sendParent("DONE");
};
#+end_src
